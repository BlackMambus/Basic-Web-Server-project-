# Basic-Web-Server-project-

A basic web server is like the host of a digital partyâ€”it receives requests (guests), finds the right content (food and drinks), and serves it back to the web browser (the guestâ€™s plate). Itâ€™s the foundation that allows websites to be accessed through the internet or a local network.

ðŸ§  What It Does
Handles HTTP Requests: Listens for incoming HTTP requests and sends back appropriate responses (HTML, CSS, JS files).

Serves Static Content: Delivers simple, non-changing files like web pages, images, or documents.

Manages Connections: Handles multiple requests, either one at a time or using basic concurrency.

Logs Activity: Keeps records of incoming requests and server responses for review or debugging.
